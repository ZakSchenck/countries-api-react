# Countries API Project (React.js)
https://lively-meerkat-751049.netlify.app/ . This project is built with React, and shows my knowledge of:
- Hooks / State
- Async/Await (API)
- CSS
- Array destructuring 
- React Router

## Biggest Project Challenge
 The biggest challenge I faced was making a search bar that filters the API when I hit backspace. To fix this, I made an empty object state instead of an array, and passed two empty arrays (Countries, and filteredCountries).
